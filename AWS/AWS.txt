Notes: 
IaaS - lets you host your applications (servers)
PaaS - lets you build your applications (functions)
SaaS - lets you use your applications (cloud hosted)
DBaaS - DB are software, so DBaaS are SaaS by definition.

# Misc 
- Code should have minimal dependencies and then be as atomic as possible. This leads to smaller and simpler microservices, leading to smaller clusters, and more flexible compute supply. Reducing dependencies reduces package bloat, and reducing obfuscation makes understanding the code less complex. Smaller and simpler containers make smaller and simpler pods. Smaller and simpler containers and pods are easier to stack in RAM and schedule across CPUs. 
- Heavy library reuse is not good, as including multiple dependencies bloats a software package while obfuscating its full functionality from even its programmer. 
- Why buy what you can make?
- What makes this proprietary standard more valuable than the industry standard? 
- Do the short term benefits of (doing X) exceed the long term support costs?
- How do game studios go cloud native? What's a better way to commit to a repo than shoving hundreds of gigabytes of textures and meshes and game levels across an Internet backbone?
- Red-green-refactor TDD process is the "buy the cheapest one and use it as a learning experience to know what you really need" strategy.
