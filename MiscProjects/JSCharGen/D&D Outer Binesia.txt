Conflict:
- Gold/Bronze keep encroaching on Rocrag out of boredom.
- Gold sees Rocrag's governor as subservient to him, and that she owns both Rocrag and Teron. Rocrag's governor sees them as equals, and Rocrag as him and his partner's. 
- Gold is the ancient head of the Rocrag Sorcerer's Guild, which Governor feels honor-bound to allow, giving Gold a justification to be on the island.
- Gold is jealous of Rocrag Cloud Fortress.
- Bronze blame Rocrag for bringing pirates (since pirates chase the cargo ships going to Rocrag)
- Rocrag fear what they see as krakens around Teron, but no adventurer so far has been able to get rid of them.

Story
- Adventurers show up in Shorebarrow, see Kraken postings on bulletin board, or hear about the Krakens in the bar.
- Adventurers travel up to Rocrag Stronghold and meet with the Governor, who gives them a boat to use for this quest.



Goal
- Don't die, and don't get killed by the dragons.
- Discover krakens are actually bronze dragons.
- Discover conflict between silver and gold dragons, and stay out of it.
- Bonus points if they mediate a solution instead of staying out of it.
