Honor vs Balance vs Wild
- How it's done (planning) is most important (Have to follow the Chain of Command) vs Getting it done now is most important and red tape is a social construct.
Altruist vs Nature vs Mavericks
- Part of an integrated society vs concerned about only themselves.

- Stupid Good - Honorable Altruist
- True Neutral - Balanced Realist 
- Lawful Evil - Honorable Maverick
- Apathetic Neutral
- Random walk as is useful to win arguments - a character that scolds others for killing troops as unnecessary slaughter, then scolds them for leaving villagers alive as unnecessary witnesses. And denies being wrong before.

Dwarven women braid their beards and hair into geometric patterns, while male dwarves use simple braids, because all dwarves treat their beards and hair as more thermal armor.

- Lost one leg and half of the other in a cave-in adventuring 20 years ago.
- Combat Wheelchair mastery (gets +5 to move speed and can move through difficult terrain as though it's normal terrain.)
- Animal Handling helps his animal friends to be better service animals in dungeons.
-- Monkey retrieves crossbow bolts.

Chucky -

- Doesn't lead the way unless completely alone, then moves very slowly, checking for traps every 5 feet.
- No penalties for no darksight because can't see anyway

Moly Bdenum - Female dwarf metallurgist. Looking for rare ores. Sees the party as a vehicle to get her safely into and out of dungeons. Lawful Neutral and does the minimum reqiured by the contract - she's all about the contract. Blind but her sentient adamantine pickaxe that drives her to find more and more rare ores helps guide her. (When she sees someone new, the pickaxe starts asking if they know about any rare ores. When she learns of the location of something rare, it keeps repeating that location until she makes plans and departs for the location. The closer she gets, the more excitement she can feel from it, until they come to the ore. And it hungers to mine. After, it acts like it had a big meal, and is basically quiet for a week, and can be used like a normal adamantine pickaxe. Only acts as a guide while on the way to ores, and she still has to find her own way back, and in town, etc.)

Chore'a Korn (Khara Karn) - female half-elf/half-orc urban druid, orc dad died questing, elf mom (cleaner for higher elves) won't talk to Chore'a about anything other than married life, because she's afraid she'll die in a dungeon like her dad. Dad named her Khara after him (Khar Karn) but her mom (Joya Munoz) sees taking care of her as just another chore, and corn is more familiar to her elven heritage than carnage. (What brought together an elf and an orc? Was her mom a prisoner of his orc clan? Nope, she rolled to seduce her attacker, and it worked for about 8 years, until he went back to questing.) So she calls herself > 
Miercoles Martinez - luchador grappler. Costume is a form fitting light blue top and pants, and light blue wool cloak that she treats like a cape. (About the name - you know, Wednesday like the Addams) 

Bard Chad Brough-Micon (Marty's)
- L2 bard
- has a permanent prestidigitation where a beat plays and club lights flash overhead when someone says his name.
- Juggling - always juggling a few billard balls
- Can "summon" 2 humanoids to party (or fight) with/for him. (where did they come from, where do they go? where did they come from, Cotton Eye Joe?)
- So good at prestidigitation that he simply uses cantrips to make any music he wants - out of nothing at all. - Develops own jungle beats for bardic inspiration etc.
Chip Brewerstone
- Animal Handler with dog and snake - is parapalegic, dog is service animal
- Lost one leg and half of the other in a cave-in adventuring 20 years ago.

Chucky

- No penalties for no darksight because can't see anyway

Tips: 
- Int check, if the player comes up with a really smart solution - can the character implement it?
- "weather event" as a monster check. Has a chance of waking people - they roll to stay asleep.
- Exhaustion checks and exhaustion monster (snagul? Can this be a corrupted Kobold?) (How many hours of sleep each night does a L1 fighter really need - can they get by on 2?)
- Roll for design and fit with non magical items - may be too big or too small, and ugly or pretty.
- Falling rock dust and rock chips as "indoor weather events" inside the Cathedral. 
- Rock dust casuses no damage, but interrupts spells, concentration, etc. 
- Rock chips cause 1d2-1 (0-1) damage.
- NPCs are attracted to players with the same highest stat. Players can roll their charisma to see if they can tell why (DM makes up a story). 
- Unnecessary killing means alignment checks, *and* a bounty 1d6+8 days later, from the creature's fam, clan, or guild
- Multiple unnecessary kills means shops close and people run when they enter towns, like the old west.
- Soundboard app for sound effects? If they're near a waterfall, play that sound, so there players have a harder time hearing each other. 
- NPCs have a trait, an ideal, a bond, a flaw, & an attraction.
- Don't punish players for going out-of-alignment, just record that their alignment has changed, and any according class changes as a result. (I.e. if a paladin kills someone, they receive no immediate punishment, but can no longer perform paladin actions, and are basically that level of fighter.) Also unlocks new abilities, as their prerequisites are met. 
- Have NPCs you need to coerce/torture, and can't kill outright - or have to overhear them talking and use that against them.
- 6 second timer or they're holding their turn. Can only hold one turn at a time, so they lose extra turns. 
- Aggressive/Timid meter

- Island of the Gold dragon - has Silver(?) dragon as mayor, Gold dragon as main, and Brass whelps as dolphin protectors?

peachwork cloak

By and large, magnetism and electricity do not work or exist in the worlds of D&D. Instead of tugging at and manipulating the Electromagnetic Force, you tug at and manipulate the Weave.

I like that "have key points in the world" and "have stuff going on at those key points" and let the players wander into it.
"Prepare situations, not events" - 100%.m 
Have scripted and realtime events happen on a world clock, whether or not the players stumble onto the plot. But we can spin new plot whole cloth.


How to deal with a party splitter - why did they split the party?
- Bored: Ask them why something happened. Give them some of the cloth generation task. 
- Confused: Railroad them into the group. 
- Contrary: 


Don't start in a bar - start in media res. They're counting treasure from the last heist or something.
make the origin story or prequel a later campaign. Great idea.
the Acquisitions Inc concept is a really solid way to do that sort of thing without the bog-standard "an adventuring party walks into a bar" thing

"It's the player's job to cause trouble, and the DM's job to make that trouble interesting."

How do you handle players, like, casting a spell above their spell level?
it goes very wrong - or even more interesting, it goes very right and they now have the notice of Important People who want to know how they did it

"inflicted backstory"... everyone was assumed to have a long history together but you weren't allowed to make it up... the rest of the party would "oh wow, this is just like that time when you ___"

Expanding on this - it goes wrong like, they expend a spell slot (or more!), or one of their other spells goes off instead, or maybe you can pick a random spell of their level that they cast that hits something!

Have the players do the describing and ask them questions about what's where.
Players do some of the world building
- maybe cooperative
- maybe start with a generic setting (dark woods) and a generic incident (you hear a weird sound) and ask them to describe it to you.

As DM, you're allowed to be curious.
Don't have so much pride that you don't share the story.
You're all on the same team - the story team.


Overnight encounters
- d4(?) = number of encounters that night
- d10 = hours 8pm-6am
- d6(?) to choose encounter type and d4(?) for number of mobs
- If nobody is awake, roll d4 for outcome
- If someone is awake, do they wake the party?

If someone wants to play: 
Different-able
- Can be any class
- Usually typecast as wizard/cleric

Blind characters
- No tremorsense
- Blind Paladin
- Online Resources

Mobility Devices
- Combat wheelchair
- Noncombat Service Familiars
- Enchanted vision goggles?

Get rid of Gatekeeps - only one way to solve problems. Go with multiple solutions.
"more than just the 'disability panel'"
Get beyond "this is to help the aspie socialize" like they did for Jackson. Go all the way to "help the aspie have an absolute blast and want to come back every week". 
Disability is non-binary and can change from day to day (Magic cursed bracers)

- Rice doesn't grow everywhere in Asia.

- Temporary (one day) blindness/deafness (reduces perception bonuses?)

- It takes nothing to switch stairs to a ramp - it's all imagination.


Objects:
Pansexual Turn Tables (Jay Exci) - Becomes an enchanted music box that takes enchanted music discs. Can be "scratched" without damaging the disc (it's enchanted), but this changes who you're attracted to.



Honor
- Avoid making an honor economy - it's a reputation, not a currency.
- Revolves around orders of knights
- Adherence to order
- Delicateca - how to socially maneuver things so you get what you need, your familiy gets what they need, community gets what they need, etc. - The more groups you satisfy at once, the more honor points it's worth?

Food and culture are tied together. And needed to survive.





Arrows are NOT a renewable resource.

DM checklist
(have or be a game engine)
- Know thy play system and rules - basically memorize them.
	- Roll to hit, roll for damage.
- Track players' locations, actions, states, slots, (arrows?) etc.
(have or be an instance generator)
- Locations within the world
- Events occurring at those locations
- NPCs performing those events
(have or be a player's friend)
- Ask them what they're trying to do and how they're trying to do it.
- Have them roll if it involves another unwilling character or is unlikely, otherwise just roll with it.
- Be willing to let them overwrite some or all of what you created during the above - if their carnival or large ravine replaces your town, have the plot happen on the fringes anyway. Someone lives there and has a conflict or problem.

Halloween One-Shot
You arrive in Rizencost, on Albatross Street, and part ways with the traveling merchant caravan after getting a few silver for your protection.
- You emerge from the treeline outside Rizencost, on one end of Albatross Street, and hide in the tall grass as you survey the town.
- Your deity/sensibilities sent you to Rizencost, because something odd is going on there, and so you find yourself on Albatross Street.
Rizencost is abuzz with fall. The leaves on about half of the trees in the forest have turned orange or red. The lamps on the lamp posts have each been covered with pumpkin illusions, and orange, red, and brown banners hang from them also. Brewers and bakers have broken out the pumpkin spice, and armor sellers have added fur lining to some of their wares. What's going on? 
- (Per 5) You see a short bulletin board near the end of Albatross Street. 27 items for sale (Enchanted blanket is always warm), one report of dangerous animals in the forest, and one Wanted poster.
-- Wanted poster: An Unknown Bard wanted for the attack of Lord Albatross. The suspect is thought use a bird for an animal companion. 10 gold reward for any information. 
-- Report of dangerous animals shows 8 missing persons, 2 dead identified, and over 2 dozen reports of clicks and screeches from the forest, mostly at night. Rizencost recommends that parties smaller than 4 don't leave the city, and traveling caravans have at least 10 guards.
- (Per 10) The largest inn, down the street, has a few city guards surrounding it. Other inns have a few rag-tag fighters standing outside. 
- (Per 12) The Temple of the Light is down the street, and the congregation outside is larger than you'd expect. They have the highest level clerics in Rizencost - 3 level 8 and 5 level 6, where the next largest temple has 1 level 7 and 2 level 6.
- (Per 14) There seem to be more city guard on duty than you'd normally expect.
- (Per 16) If you stand still for a few seconds, you can hear a soft sound from the forest. 

= Huge spiders: Someone dropped a wand of Giant Growth (100 charges) in the forest and the spiders have been using it on each other. There are currently 4d8. Each day the number increases by 2d8, until the total of 100 charges in the wand are used.
= Unknown Druid: Got mad at Lord Albatross for building the Albatross Inn over the druid's grove. Also dropped the wand of Giant Growth when it fell out of his pack. He was planning to make himself giant for 100 days and attack the town, but had to come up with a Plan B after losing the wand: trample the roof and smash the window, slash Lord Albatross his bed in the master bedroom of the Albatross Inn, then fly away as a bird. The druid lives as a city rat most of the time, sneaking between alleys and basements.

Eye ring is for the Circle of the Eye, a druidic circle run by devils, in their quest to gain more souls.
