How to install Audacity inside a container?
Host websites. What's after this? Download the container instead of the website - is this just apps all over again?
Incubation & Startup Advising
- Designing 3d printed products that people can buy.
- Animation (make animation of your process of animating - animated flowchart)
- Solutions Architect 
Overlay rental and house sales price on the same map.


# Combine A and B
- Make 3d comparative levels of architecture solutions - tech level, tech flavor, tech maturity (Gartner bracket) 
- How do game studios go cloud native? Epic?
- Why buy what you can make?
- What makes your proprietary standard more valuable than the industry standard? 

- Getting companies to stop operating like it's 2006 or 2014 and act like it's 2022. (messaging)
- Replacing with SaaS allows coupling costs to usage much more effectively than hiring contractors to mange your IaaS.
- To move from the multi-network hydra of VPC foam:
	1. Main
	2. Audit
	3. Logging
	4. Security Dev
	5. Security Prod
	6. Corp Dev
	7. Corp Test
	8. Corp Prod
	9. AppA Dev
	10. AppA Test 
	11. AppA Stage
	12. AppA QA
	13. AppA Prod
	14. AppB Dev
	15. AppB Test 
	16. AppB Stage
	17. AppB QA
	18. AppB Prod
	19. DevOps Dev
	20. DevOps Test
	21. DevOps Prod

Remodel your workflow of Dev -> (Test -> Stage -> QA ->) Prod (a few stacks are optional in some applications)
to a workflow more like Dev locally -> Commit -> CI/CD pipeline [automated unit Testing -> automated Build -> automated stack Validation -> automated Deploy] -> automated blue/green rebalancing (until only the new version is running).

Which reduces you down to:
	1. Main
	2. Audit
	3. Logging
	4. Security Prod
	5. Security is using entirely SaaS products.
		1. Security Dev
	- Corp is using entirely SaaS products.
		2. Corp Dev 
		3. Corp Test
		4. Corp Prod
	- CI/CD pipeline handles these steps.
		5. App Dev
		6. App Test
		7. App Stage
		8. App QA
	6. App Prod
		9. App Dev
		10. App Test
		11. App Stage
		12. App QA
	7. App Prod
	- CI/CD pipeline is entirely SaaS products.
		13. DevOps Dev
		14. DevOps Test
		15. DevOps Prod

- SaaS cost differential


# CLI
- Programmatic Access must be setup from IAM
- aws configure command sets up IAM keys, stored plaintext on the filesystem, so use roles instead wherever possible.
- Installed via Python script

# CloudFormation
- Best use is to automate the provisioning of resources and InfraAsCode
- JSON or YAML
- Errors rollback with message "ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS"
## CloudFormation Templates
- Must define at least one resource.
- Larger than 51,200 bytes (0.05 MB) must be imported from S3 bucket
- Can be nested into NestedStacks. 
- Fields:
	- MetaData - extra info
	- Description - of the template
	- Parameters - user inputs
	- Transforms - Macros to modify data.
	- Outputs - Become inputs into other stacks.
	- Mappings - key value lookup table
	- Resources - define what to provision (minimum 1)
	- Conditions - control if resources get created and/or properties assigned.

# CloudFront CDN
- Origin is storage location of data. (S3, Private S3 through Origin Access Identity (OAI), EC2, ELB, R53, etc)
- Distribution defines a collection of Edge Locations and behavior on how it should handle your cached content.
- 2 types: Web (static content) and RTMP (streaming media) 
- Security through Signed URLs or Signed Cookies.
- Distributes cached copies to Edge Locations. 
- Write to Edge Locations with verbs like PUT objects. (How does this work and what are the use cases? Invalidate cache for a specific location, or A/B test stuff in a specific region?)
- Lambda@Edge allows passing requests through a Lambda to transform.
- TTL defines cache expiry in seconds.
- Invalidating cache immediately expires the cached items, so they refresh immediately.
- Refreshing a cached item has a bandwidth cost of moving the item from origin to edge.

# CloudTrail
- Logs calls between AWS services.
- Involves governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing.
- Can be configured to gather all logs in all regions in all accounts across an AWS Organization. 
- Default is 90 days via Event History, and beyond 90 days requires creating a Trail, which is logged to an S3 bucket, and can be analyzed with Athena.
CloudTrail Logs
- Log Validation prevents tampering. (How?)
- Encryption with KMS
- Can be streamed to CloudWatch Logs
- 2 event kinds: management (operations like IAM) and data (resources like EC2 or Lambda). Trails don't include data events by default.

# CloudWatch
- Collection of monitoring services: Dashboards, Events, Alarms, Logs, Metrics
- Most services default to 1 minute reporting intervals, with options for 1, 3, and 5. 
- EC2 starts with 5 and calls the 1 min option "detailed monitoring" (does it cost more?) - CloudWatch Agent required.
- Can stream custom logs too.
CloudWatch Dashboards
- Visualize metrics
CloudWatch Events
- Trigger AWS events based on condition (use case hourly snapshots)
CloudWatch Alarms
- Notifications based on metrics
CloudWatch Logs
- Data point logging
- Must belong to log group
CloudWatch Metrics
- Capture one data point across time.
- Custom Metrics allow much higher resolution, down to 1 second.

# Cognito
- Decentralized managed auth. 
- User Pools directory allows users to auth using OAuth to IdP (Meta, AZ, Netflix?, Goog, AAD, itself, etc) 
	- Uses JWTs to persist auth
- Identity Pools can provide temp AWS creds for service access (S3, DynamoDB, etc)
- Cognito Sync can sync user data and preferences across devices with one line of code (powered by SNS)
- Web Identity Federation exchanges identity and security info between IdP and apps.
- IdP is a trusted login source for other services. 
	- OIDC is an Oauth type of IdP.
	- SAML is an SSO type of IdP.

# DNS
- Domain Name Service converts domain names into IPs and back.
- IPv4 - 32 bit address space (relatively limited)
- IPv6 - 128 bit address space (relatively unlimited)
- TLD i.e. .com
- 2LD i.e. Gilgamech.com
- Domain Registrar is a 3rd party company who sells domains.
- Name Servers are the DNS servers with your domain info.
- Start of Authority (SOA) contains info about the DNS zone and associated records.
- A Record converts directly into an IPv4 address.
- CName Record redirects to another record.
- Time To Live (TTL) is record cache duration. 

# EBS
- Elastic Block Store is a virtual block-level storage drive that you can attach to a single EC2 instance. 
- Volume dimensions (size, storage type) can be changed at any time.
- Instance Store Volumes are physical storage attached to a host, and cannot be stopped - if the host fails, the data is lost. (What is the use case for these?)
- EBS backed instances can be stopped without data loss.
- Root volumes delete on termination by default.
- Volumes can have termination protection. 
- Restoring a snapshots of an encrypted volume will give you a snaphsot that is still encrypted, and you can't share encrypted snapshots.
- Unencrypted snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public. (Why would you want to make a snapshot public?)
## Snapshots
- Snapshots are incremental point-in-time copies, and only changes made since the last snapshot are moved to S3.
- Initial snapshots will take longer than subsequent snapshots.
- EC2 instance should be stopped before snapshotting root volume. But other disks can be taken while the server is running. 
- AMIs can be created from snapshots, or volumes.
