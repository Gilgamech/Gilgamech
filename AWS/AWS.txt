# Misc 
Code should have minimal dependencies and then be as atomic as possible. This dual mandate leads to smaller and simpler microservices, leading to smaller clusters, and more flexible compute supply. Reducing dependencies reduces package bloat, and reducing obfuscation makes understanding the code less complex. Smaller and simpler containers make smaller and simpler pods. Smaller and simpler containers and pods are easier to stack in RAM and schedule across CPUs. 
Heavy library reuse is not good, as including multiple dependencies bloats a software package while obfuscating its full functionality from even its programmer. 
The short term benefits of (doing X) exceeds the long term support costs.

Notes: 
IaaS - lets you host your applications (servers)
PaaS - lets you build your applications (functions)
SaaS - lets you use your applications (cloud hosted)
DBaaS - DB are software, so DBaaS are SaaS by definition.

# AWS Services
## Amplify
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- PaaS
- Use Case: mobile SDKs to connect to AWS infra.

## App Runner
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- SaaS
- Use Case: Point at container and it handles all the orchestration.

## Block Storage (EBS?)
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- IaaS
- Use Case: Used for high-data requirements, but needs manual config.

## Bracket
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- IaaS
- Use Case: Quantum Computing

## CLI
- Cost: Free
- Encryption: SSL
- PaaS
- Use Case: perform various tasks like list buckets, upload data, launch, start, stop, and terminate EC2 instances, update security groups, create subnets, etc.
- Easily switch between accounts with --profile
- Change --output between JSON, Table, and Text.
- Programmatic Access must be setup from IAM
- aws configure command sets up IAM keys, stored plaintext on the filesystem, so use roles instead wherever possible.
- Installed via Python script

## CloudFormation
- Cost: 
- Encryption: are templates encrypted?
- IaaS
- Use Case: automate the provisioning of resources and Infrastructure As Code.
- JSON or YAML
- Errors rollback with message "ROLLBACK_IN_PROGRESS"
### CloudFormation Templates
- Must define at least one resource.
- Larger than 51,200 bytes (0.05 MB) must be imported from S3 bucket
- Can be nested into NestedStacks. 
- Fields:
	- MetaData - extra info
	- Description - of the template
	- Parameters - user inputs
	- Transforms - Macros to modify data.
	- Outputs - Become inputs into other stacks.
	- Mappings - key value lookup table
	- Resources - define what to provision (minimum 1)
	- Conditions - control if resources get created and/or properties assigned.

## CloudFront CDN
- Cost: 
- Encryption: (Are there use cases for non-public CDNs, like large companies? Does Amazon/AWS use CDNs to accelerate internal proprietary content? Are the edge copies encrypted?)
- IaaS
- Use Case: Distributes cached copies to Edge Locations for faster worldwide retrieval. 
- Origin is storage location of data. (S3, Private S3 through Origin Access Identity (OAI), EC2, ELB, R53, etc)
- Distribution defines a collection of Edge Locations and behavior on how it should handle your cached content.
- 2 types: Web (static content) and RTMP (streaming media) 
- Security through Signed URLs or Signed Cookies.
- Write to Edge Locations with verbs like PUT objects. (How does this work and what are the use cases? Invalidate cache for a specific location, or A/B test stuff in a specific region?)
- Lambda@Edge allows passing requests through a Lambda to transform.
- TTL defines cache expiry in seconds.
- Invalidating cache immediately expires the cached items, so they refresh immediately.
- Refreshing a cached item has a bandwidth cost of moving the item from origin to edge.

## CloudTrail
- Cost: 
- Encryption: Are trails encrypted?
- SaaS
- Use Case: Logs calls between AWS services.
- Involves governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing.
- Can be configured to gather all logs in all regions in all accounts across an AWS Organization. 
- Default is 90 days via Event History, and beyond 90 days requires creating a Trail, which is logged to an S3 bucket, and can be analyzed with Athena.
### CloudTrail Logs
- Log Validation prevents tampering. (How?)
- Encryption: KMS
- Can be streamed to CloudWatch Logs
- 2 event kinds: management (operations like IAM) and data (resources like EC2 or Lambda). Trails don't include data events by default.

## CloudWatch
- Cost: 
- SaaS
- Use Case: Monitoring
- You can track the amount of data written to AWS using Amazon CloudWatch. https://aws.amazon.com/c-tax-faqs/
- Collection of monitoring services: Dashboards, Events, Alarms, Logs, Metrics
- Most services default to 1 minute reporting intervals, with options for 1, 3, and 5. 
- EC2 starts with 5 and calls the 1 min option "detailed monitoring" (does it cost more?) - CloudWatch Agent required.
- Can stream custom logs too.
### CloudWatch Dashboards
- Encryption: Are Dashboards encrypted?
- Visualize metrics
### CloudWatch Events
- Encryption: Are Events encrypted?
- Trigger AWS events based on condition (use case hourly snapshots)
### CloudWatch Alarms
- Encryption: Are Alarms encrypted?
- Notifications based on metrics
### CloudWatch Logs
- Encryption: Are Logs encrypted?
- Data point logging
- Must belong to log group
### CloudWatch Metrics
- Encryption: Are Metrics encrypted?
- Capture one data point across time.
- Custom Metrics allow much higher resolution, down to 1 second.

## Cognito
- Cost: 
- Encryption: Are user pools and identity pools encrypted? Where are they stored?
- PaaS
- Use Case: Decentralized managed auth. 
- User Pools directory allows users to auth using OAuth to IdP (Meta, AZ, Netflix?, Google, AAD, itself, etc) 
	- Uses JWTs to persist auth
- Identity Pools can provide temp AWS creds for service access (S3, DynamoDB, etc)
- Cognito Sync can sync user data and preferences across devices with one line of code (powered by SNS)
- Web Identity Federation exchanges identity and security info between IdP and apps.
- IdP is a trusted login source for other services. 
	- OIDC is an Oauth type of IdP.
	- SAML is an SSO type of IdP.

## Data Exchange
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- SaaS
- Use Case: Buy someone else's data to process, or use 3rd party data

## Datasync
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- IaaS
- Use Case: Data transfer agent deployed on a VM in your network, an EC2 Outpost in your network, or on an AWS Snowcone in your network.

## ODS-DocumentDB
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- PaaS
- Use Case: notMongoDB with 1:1 to be allowed to charge money for open sourced applications.

## ODS-DynamoDB
- Cost: 
- Encryption:
- PaaS
- Use Case: Fully managed NOSQL key/value & document DB.
	- Easy to scale document DB, but no joins and limited queries.
	- Good for applications with large amounts of data and need predictable read & write while scaling. 
- Scales to meet the specified read and write (per second) capacities.
- Data stored as 3 copies on SSDs in 3 regions.
- Two consistency modes: 
	- Eventually (1 sec) Consistent Reads - can return inconsistent immediate reads too.
	- Strongly Consistent Reads - will wait until data is consistent (1 sec) before returning, with higher latencies due to no immediate read option.

## EBS
- Cost: 
- Encryption: KMS?
- IaaS
- Use Case: virtual block-level storage drive that you can attach to a single EC2 instance. 
- Volume dimensions (size, storage type) can be changed at any time.
- Instance Store Volumes are physical storage attached to a host, and cannot be stopped - if the host fails, the data is lost. (What is the use case for these?)
- EBS backed instances can be stopped without data loss.
- Root volumes delete on termination by default.
- Volumes can have termination protection.
### Snapshots
- Snapshots are incremental point-in-time copies, and only changes made since the last snapshot are moved to S3.
- Initial snapshots will take longer than subsequent snapshots.
- EC2 instance should be stopped before snapshotting root volume. But other disks can be taken while the server is running. 
- Restoring a snapshots of an encrypted volume will give you a snapshot that is still encrypted, and you can't share encrypted snapshots.
- Unencrypted snapshots can be shared with other AWS accounts or made public. (Why would you want to make a snapshot public?)
- AMIs can be created from snapshots, or volumes.

		- Advanced routing rules (can route based on subdomain header, path, and other HTTP(S) info.)
		- Can have sticky sessions which are remembered by cookie.
	- Network:
		- Has Listeners and Target Groups but is a lawless place.
		- For TCP/UDP and is good for high throughput i.e. video games.
		- Can't have sticky sessions?
	- Classic:
		- Has Listeners with EC2 instances registered directly.
		- For legacy and is being depreciated
		- Can have sticky sessions which are remembered by cookie.

- AWS account creation normally starts with root user account setup. 
- Always setup MFA for root accounts.
- New accounts have no permissions until assigned.
- New users get an access key and secret key when created with the programmatic access option set.
- Access keys are only for CLI / SDK access and not for console access.
- Access secret keys are only shown on creation - if lost they must be made again.
- Users must setup MFA for themselves, and this can't be done by an admin. (is this true?)
- IAM allows setting password policies like minimum length or rotation time. 
- IAM identities are users, groups, and roles.
- IAM user accounts allow users to use the AWS Console, or CLI or SDK.
- IAM Groups allow grouping users with the same permissions.
- IAM Roles associate permissions with a resource. 
- IAM Policies are JSON documents listing specific permissions. 
	- Managed Policies are read-only from AWS
	- Customer Policies are ones you make and maintain.

# Misc 
- Code should have minimal dependencies and then be as atomic as possible. This leads to smaller and simpler microservices, leading to smaller clusters, and more flexible compute supply. Reducing dependencies reduces package bloat, and reducing obfuscation makes understanding the code less complex. Smaller and simpler containers make smaller and simpler pods. Smaller and simpler containers and pods are easier to stack in RAM and schedule across CPUs. 
- Heavy library reuse is not good, as including multiple dependencies bloats a software package while obfuscating its full functionality from even its programmer. 
- Why buy what you can make?
- What makes this proprietary standard more valuable than the industry standard? 
- Do the short term benefits of (doing X) exceed the long term support costs?
- How do game studios go cloud native? What's a better way to commit to a repo than shoving hundreds of gigabytes of textures and meshes and game levels across an Internet backbone?
- Red-green-refactor TDD process is the "buy the cheapest one and use it as a learning experience to know what you really need" strategy.

# DBaaS paradigms https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W2Z7fbCLSTw
1. Key-Value: Basically remote variables. Remote Procedure Call where the Remote Procedure just stores and responds with the data sent to it.
	- Data is stored as: Values that are attached to keys.
	- Use Case: Very fast in-memory caching to supplement another database option.
	- Non-Ideal: Structured or general site data, joins. 
	- Schema: No
	- Horizontal: Very good
	- Offerings: Elasticache, Redis 

2. Wide Column: Structured key-value.
	- Data is stored as: Values that are attached to keys. The value's properties are treated as columns, grouped almost into tables.
	- Use Case: Provides CQL which is similar to SQL. Best used to supplement another database option.
	- Non-Ideal: Structured or general site data, joins.
	- Schema: No
	- Horizontal: Very good
	- Offerings: Cassandra, Oracle HBase (Kinda what AWS Glue does for AWS Athena.)

3. Document: Highly structured key-value.
	- Data is stored as: JSON Documents as unstructured containers for key:value pairs, and these are grouped into collections. Fields in collections can be indexed into hierarchies. This gives a good amount of relational data. No joins, so embed data instead of normalizing it.
	- Use Case: Phone games, IOT, Content Management, anywhere you have a lot of unstructured data. Much faster reads. 
	- Non-Ideal: Structured data, joins. Writes etc aren't much faster. 
	- Schema: No
	- Horizontal: Good?
	- Offerings: MongoDB, FirestormDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB, SimpleDB, etc.

4. Relational: Oldest DB (since 1974), uses SQL. 
	- Data is stored as: Tables of rows with primary key IDs, with data set in typed columns. Allows referencing a foreign key ID from another table, and performing joins between tables. Operates best when data has been normalized into the smallest normal form. ACID compliant, which normally makes it hard to scale.
	- Use Case: Banks, financial institutions, long-term structured data storage. Usual starting DB choice, since it's the first.
	- Non-Ideal: Unstructured data.
	- Schema: Yes
	- Horizontal: Usually poor, but some solutions have good scalability.
	- Offerings: SQLite, PostGres, MySQL, MSSQL, CochroachDB, numerous others. 

5. Graph: To set up a many:many relationship, instead of the Relational model's creating a Join Table with foreign keys of both tables, we just set up the data and the various edges between them, no middle table needed. Makes queries much simpler and easier, and gives better performance on big data with join-heavy queries. Uses Cypher query language.
	- Data is stored as: Nodes, with relationships between them as edges.
	- Use Case: Knowledge graphs, fraud detection, recommendation engines. (Intrusion detection?)
	- Non-Ideal: Unstructured data.
	- Schema: No?
	- Horizontal: ???
	- Offerings: Neo4j, DGraph

6. Search: The search term is then used as the key, and the list of documents in the searchable term index is the value.
	- Data is stored as: JSON Documents as unstructured containers, and the words in these are indexed into searchable terms. 
	- Use Case: Index data for searching. Can run numerous typo, ranking, relevance, and recommendation algorithms, at the cost of speed and flexibility - but could be valuable as a type-ahead search box.
	- Non-Ideal: Structured data, unstructured data for quick retrieval, joins, general site data.
	- Schema: No?
	- Horizontal: ???
	- Offerings:  Apache Lucene (Elastic, Solr), Algolia, Meili

7. Multi-model: Uses modeling to pick the optimal DB type foreach type of data added. Can add documents to collections. 
	- Data is stored as: structured and unstructured as needed.
	- Use Case: Abstract away data modeling, schemas, replication, shards, etc.
	- Non-Ideal: ???
	- Schema: When needed.
	- Horizontal: ???
	- Offerings: FaunaDB

8. Time-Series
	- Data is stored as: 
	- Use Case: 
	- Non-Ideal: 
	- Schema: 
	- Horizontal: 
	- Offerings: 

9. Data Warehouse
	- Data is stored as: 
	- Use Case: 
	- Non-Ideal: 
	- Schema: 
	- Horizontal: 
	- Offerings: 

10. Data Lake
	- Data is stored as: 
	- Use Case: 
	- Non-Ideal: 
	- Schema: 
	- Horizontal: 
	- Offerings: AWS Data Lake
